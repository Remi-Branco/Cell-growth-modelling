# Cell-division-modelling

Small utility to study coordination between cell expansion/division.  Model based on work from Jones et al, 2017 (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15060).

C++ makes it super fast to simulate thousands of cells.

## To change model parameters
Change corresponding parameters in cpp files (e.g. m_growthRate for cellular growth rate, etc..) and compile.
Results are provided as .csv files.
