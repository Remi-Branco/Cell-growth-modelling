# Cell-division-modelling

I needed a small utility to study coordination between cell expansion/division.

The mathematical model is based on the great work of Jones, A. R. et al. 2017 (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15060).

This code simply re-implements the two-stage cell cycle model coupling cell growth with cyclin/CDK activities described in their paper.

C++ makes it super fast to simulate thousands of cells.


## Change model parameters
Change corresponding parameters in cpp files (e.g. m_growthRate for cellular growth rate, etc..) and compile.
Results are provided as .csv files.


## Need more info ?
Contact me @ remi.branco@hotmail.fr if you need more info on the model's parameters.
